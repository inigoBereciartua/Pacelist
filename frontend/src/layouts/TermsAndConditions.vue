                <p>
                    This app connects to your Spotify account to access limited data necessary for core functionality, including:

                    <li>Creating and managing playlists based on your preferences.</li>
                </ul>

            <section>
                <h2>3. Session Management</h2>
                <p>
                    User sessions are stored in memory only for the duration of your activity within the app. Upon logout or session expiration, all session data is cleared, and you will need to reauthorize the app to reconnect with Spotify.
